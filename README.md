# kheiron_coding_test

Coding test instructions: https://github.com/Kheiron-Medical/SWE_Take_Home_Exercise/blob/master/README.md

This is my personal attempt at the above coding test. Included initial worse recursive implementation, as well as a 2nd better thought out approach whereby numbers are put into a stack and operators into a queue. (`evaluate_elt_list_with_recursion` vs `evaluate_elt_list_with_queue_stack`)
